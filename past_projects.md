# Engineering Service

I have provid engineering service to customers as 1099 employment.

## Past Projects

### Electrical Timed Catalist Injection Contorl

Industrial equipment with 24V/12V power needed a metered catalyst, so I did a circuit board with a microcontroller (AVR) and an SMPS (POL) to operate a small pump at timed intervals and accumulate pump operation time. An LED was used to indicate when the catalyst charge was nearing the end of its expected life.

## What is 1099 employment

Cash (>$600) paid for contracted work to an individual.
