Hi, I am Ron. I am an electrical engineer that likes a mix of power electronics and microcontrolers. I am in the process of swithing gears back to my microcontroler projects, I was not able to do much of that at my last job, but now that I have admin rights on the computer in frount of me agin... I can make progress. Three and a half years ago I was starting to get the hang of VSCode with Intelasense for AVR microcontrolers and thought that was amazing, but looking at how AI can get projects started now... it is just nuts I can't beleive how much has changed in such a short time.

## Question of the year is

Do you think an embedded developer needs admin rights on their computer? Lets ask a couple of AI's

I was not using Linux at my last job, but I like how sudo allows a regular user to increas privlage with an added athuntication step, Windows is in desperate need of that. I don't know the answer for smallish outfits that don't have the IT resources to keep one or more tool-chains up to date and functinal. After three and a half years of pestering IT to updating MPLAB and its compiler, and then a Win 10 to 11 update MPLAB was actually bricking the PICkit so I gave up and told everyone that I had forgoten how to write programs... as you know that didn't go over well, still I was in need of a break so all is perfict.

## Thanks for visiting

That is it for now.
