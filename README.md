Hi, I am Ron. I am a hardware developer (more or less). 


## Overview

I'm starting to get the hang of the AVR toolchain, I think it is a good place to gain understanding before I grapple with the ARM or RISC-V toolchain.


## Status

Working on my Gravimetric project (circuit board and software).


## How I work

I mostly lean towards withered (“weathered”) technology (not cutting edge) which is abundant, well-understood, and cheap. 

I can do Python, and C (not C++, but C like how Linux is done). To be clear I am not a Dev, I do not much like GUI or UI software. I would describe the software I do as daemon like I tend to debug it with a command-line interface (e.g., a terminal). IoT, is also not my thing, e.g., placing networking services on bare metal is... 

I use to keep test programs in CVS then SVN followed by Mercurial. Now I am also using Git. It is unbelievable how much these CM tools have progressed.


## Need help with a project

I spent over 15 years as a test engineer on an SMD line that produced power conversion products for telecom. I got to see a lot go wrong during that time. Don't ICT unless you lay out the board for ICT (but AOI is a good way to go). I am a fan of functional and self-testing (with constraints that prevent damage). On my projects, I develop the test early and then change it if I need to change things during evaluation. I have done a fair number of prototype boards and have confidence that I can do that for others, but it is still done by hand placing parts so SMD should mostly be 0805 with a few 0603.
